# Editor Instructions - W16 Script Portal

Welcome! This guide explains how to use the W16 Script Portal to submit your scripts for approval before creating content.

---

## Why Use the Portal?

All scripts must be submitted through the portal **before** using any AI tool (Veo 3, MakeUGC, ElevenLabs, Higgsfield). This helps us:

- Track content creation across the team
- Ensure all content aligns with our brands
- Maintain quality standards

---

## Your API Key

You have been assigned a unique API key. **Keep it private** - it identifies all your submissions.

Your key looks like: `ap_yourname_xxxxxxxxxxxx` or `le_yourname_xxxxxxxxxxxx`

- `ap_` = Aurapets brand
- `le_` = LuminEye brand

## How to Submit a Script

### Step 1: Go to the Portal

Open: **[Portal URL will be provided by admin]**

### Step 2: Enter Your API Key

- Paste your API key in the first field
- You'll see your name and brand appear when connected

### Step 3: Select the AI Tool

Choose which tool you'll use to create this content:
- 🎬 **Veo 3** - Video generation
- 👤 **MakeUGC** - UGC content
- 🎙️ **ElevenLabs** - Voice generation
- ✨ **Higgsfield** - AI video

### Step 4: Paste Your Script

- Enter your **complete** script or prompt
- Include all text that will be generated
- The more complete, the better the approval process works

### Step 5: Submit for Approval

Click **"Submit for Approval"** and wait a few seconds.

## What Happens Next

### ✅ If Approved

You'll see a green "Script Approved" screen with:
- Confirmation of your submission
- Next steps for using the selected tool
- Instructions to proceed

**You may now use the AI tool to create your content.**

### 🚨 If Flagged

You'll see a red "Script Flagged" screen. This means:
- The content may not match your assigned brand
- An admin has been notified
- You should contact your supervisor if you believe this is a mistake

**Do not proceed with creating this content until resolved.**

---

## Important Rules

1. **Always submit first** - Never use AI tools without portal approval
2. **Use your own key** - Never share or use someone else's API key
3. **Complete scripts only** - Submit the full script, not just notes
4. **One script per submission** - Submit each script separately
